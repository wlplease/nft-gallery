## Rewards

Exciting rewards are coming soon to Voloview! To scale our development and operations, we believe in fostering a collaborative environment where contributors are recognized and rewarded for their valuable input. We prefer paid trials to get to know developers better and ensure they fit well with our team. The more your PRs get merged into the main branch, the more likely you'll become an integral part of our inner team. We welcome on-demand or part-time contributions and will reward them generously in $DOT.

Rewarding Contributions with $DOT
At Voloview, we prefer to compensate your work in $DOT, the native cryptocurrency of the Polkadot network, which holds intrinsic value and aligns with our commitment to decentralized technologies.

Creating Your DOT Address
To create your DOT address securely and for long-term use, we recommend you install the Polkadot.js wallet browser extension. You can learn more about the process of creating a DOT address at the official Polkadot Guide.

Sharing Your Address to Receive Rewards
After setting up your account, you can visit KodaDot Transfer to generate a payment link. Simply enter an amount (e.g., 100 USD), click COPY REWARD ME LINK, and share this link with us when you submit a bug report or pull request.

Your receiving address link will look something like this:

https://voloview.com/dot/transfer?target=${your address}&usdamount=100&donation=true


Switching Account/Network
In your accounts dashboard, ensure you’re connected to the correct network by checking the top-left corner. If necessary, click the avatar to switch networks.

Checking Your DOT Balance
You can view your balance by going to balances in your accounts dashboard. Ensure that you’re on the Polkadot network by confirming the top-left corner. If your balance is not in DOT, switch to the Polkadot network by adjusting the avatar settings. Alternatively, you can check your balance on Subscan by entering your address in the search box.



Which Issue to Pick?
We recommend starting with recent issues labeled p1 or p2. These are often challenging and will showcase your skills effectively.
