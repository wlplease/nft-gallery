## Responsibilities

- Ensure the quality and reliability of the Voloview NFT gallery through thorough testing
- Work closely with the development team to identify, report, and resolve issues in a timely manner
- Collaborate with the community, both in discussion and implementation of new features
- Participate in code reviews, maintaining high code quality standards
- Use various testing methodologies and tools to validate the functionality and performance of the product
- Offload 30% of dev work by checking if specific PRs work as intended, reporting and raising bugs that break UX, identifying missing functionality that was accidentally removed
- Write and update end-to-end (E2E) and unit tests (using Playwright/Vitest)
- Communicate with the team in issues to help offload major context switching from devs
- Tech-savvy QA is preferred
- Give "works-for-me" labels on PRs if things work as intended

- Understanding of KodaDot's tech stack and infrastructure
- Strong communication skills for effective collaboration with the community and team
- Familiarity with Voloview's coding conventions and recommendations
- Knowledge of GraphQL / REST API is an andvantage

## Quality Assurance

To have a faster pace of development, as our current pace of pull-requests was hitting 250 pull-requests in February on a monthly average, we've realized we need more people to participate and to share more humble and honest feedback with developers on their work.

The result would be that we could deliver user experience quality in a shorter time window. It's pretty natural that developers sometimes miss delivering the 100% specification in an issue or something breaks. It happens, and no need to make drama out of it. Everyone is learning.

Until we have E2E tests complete on KodaDot, we would like to happily reward your participation for your input on our pull-requests to the codebase.

To participate, you must respect our code of conduct below.

## Code of Conduct

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
